# Gesture-Controlled-Snake-Game

Acknowledgements
This project builds upon the base game designed by @dimatrubca | repository: https://github.com/dimatrubca/multi-level-snake-game?utm_source=chatgpt.com
It served as the foundation for the core game logic while I implemented gesture control as an experimental addition.

This project is purely educational and curiosity-driven, with no intention of commercial use.

Features

Hand Gesture Control: Real-time hand tracking with 3-second calibration system
Multiple Difficulty Levels: 7 speed levels (L1-L7) and 4 progressive game levels
Visual Themes: 4 arena backgrounds (Grass, Fire, Water, Desert)
Game Enhancements: Bonus items, dynamic obstacles, persistent high scores
Hybrid Controls: Both gesture and keyboard input support

Requirements

Python 3.x
pygame
opencv-python
mediapipe

Usage
Run python main.py and follow the calibration process to start playing with hand gestures, or use arrow keys as backup controls.
